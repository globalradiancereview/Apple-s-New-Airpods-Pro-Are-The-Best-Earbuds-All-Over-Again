# Apple-s-New-Airpods-Pro-Are-The-Best-Earbuds-All-Over-Again
Apple's new Airpods are the best pair of wireless headphones you can buy. They're not perfect, but they're close enough to make it worth your time and money. The AirPods Pro cost more than the normal AirPods, and it is not clear why. The only difference between them is that the Pro has a case for protection and better sound quality, which makes sense if you want to use them in public places, but does not make sense if you just want to listen to music at home or in the office.     The first thing that jumps out at you when you take a look at the new Airpods is how tiny they are. Without the charging case, they look like any other pair of headphones, with a single small button on each earbud and a circular power button on their backs. The charging case adds another button on each side, which adds some extra functionality in addition to charging.     That small size makes them easy to wear for hours on end, and the wireless setup means that there's no cable connecting them to your phone or computer (or even any other device). It's just you and your music — which is exactly what we want from our headphones these days.The only downside is that they cost $159, which is more than twice as much as the standard version. But if you can afford it and you really want what Apple's offering here — the best earbuds ever — then go for it.     The first generation of AirPods were released in 2016 and consisted of simple, oval-shaped earbuds that could be clipped into a case to connect them to each other wirelessly. They were well-received, but the design felt like an evolutionary step backward from what we'd seen with Apple's earphones over the years — like a second-generation version of those old wired EarPods that came with every iPhone since 2007.     The new AirPods Pro are different in two major ways: First, they're much bigger and bulkier, thanks to their ability to connect to each other wirelessly through Bluetooth 5 (they still require a cable if you want to go wired). Second, instead of being oval-shaped like their predecessors, these new buds are more like traditional earphones: They have defined edges and a thicker profile that makes them feel less awkward when you aren't wearing them.     But one of the most important features of these new wireless headphones is that they're wireless — meaning you don't have to worry about tangling your cord around your neck or getting them caught on things as you walk around. The first generation of AirPods were fine at staying in your ears but had a few issues: They didn't stay in your ears very well when exercising or dancing, and they could fall out unexpectedly if you moved too much. The second-generation AirPods fixed those problems by adding an accelerometer inside each bud that measures motion when you move around while wearing them so they'll stay put better than before.     Apple has been very good at keeping the AirPod user base up to date with its latest updates. The company has released three iOS updates over a period of six months, each containing various improvements and bug fixes. It also released a new version of the AirPods firmware on May 15th, which contains an option for users to store their preference for the "Find My AirPods'' feature on the device itself — rather than having it stored in iCloud.     In addition to this, there's been plenty of chatter about improvements in battery life and charging speeds, but not much else. We're still waiting for Apple to release some sort of extended warranty program for its AirPods — something that other manufacturers like Bose and Jabra have already implemented — but hopefully we'll see something soon
